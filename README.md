# BDXHelper
A set of additional helper modules for BDX, the Blender-integrated LibGDX-powered open-source cross-platform 3D game engine.

This set contains quite a few features, like:

- An Aseprite-integrated sprite animation component.
- A Trail component for weapon trails, scarves, etc.
- Random room generation.
- Other stuff!

The wiki will be updated over time with documentation for each individual component / utility.
